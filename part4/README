Program usage:
The program takes one argument which should be a path to the input file.

$ ./a.out <input_file>

The program will then output a preliminary version of the symbol table along with the
annotated syntax tree generated from the input file, if it is part of the language.
Should there be errors, the program will instead list them along with their
positions in the text (line and column numbers, where tabs count as 4 columns).



Compilation instructions

1. (Optional) Generate the lexical analyzer .c source code through FLEX
$ flex language.l

2. (Optional) Generate the syntax analyzer .c source code through GNU Bison
$ bison language.y

3. Compile the program
$ gcc -std=c18 -m64 -O3 src/main.c src/node.c src/node-list.c src/table.c src/table-stack.c src/arg-list.c src/parser.c src/scanner.c

- Alternatively, a makefile has also been provided which will run all commands
$ make
OR
$ make flex   # for step 1
$ make bison  # for step 2
$ make rel    # for step 3
